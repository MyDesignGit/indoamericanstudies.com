To make the most of it, get ready to introduce  yourself in a positive way to fellow students, professors, and other people both  on- and off-campus.<br/>
                                              One of your first introductions to social life on a U.S. campus will most likely  be &quot;The International Student Orientation Program,&quot; traditionally coordinated  by the Admissions Office or the Office of International Programs. Orientation varies  greatly from school to school, though the objectives are similar: to introduce the  new non-U.S. students to each other, and to prepare you for campus life. Many times,  topics include immigration, academic advisors, computer and library resources, telephone  services, public safety, medical services, and banking and transportation options.  (Be sure to see Study/ Living: Money Matters for more details about money management  during your stay.) During orientation, students often learn of upcoming activities  such as trips to local points of attraction.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> College and university campuses are abound with activities designed to foster friendships.  Many schools designate a &quot;Student Activities Center&quot; (also called a student  union) where you may learn of different activities and programs, such as student  government, the newspaper staff, outdoors club, chorus, dance, and a number of athletic  teams. Explore which ones may suit you best!</p>

He is in his  third year of a four-year undergraduate program, and intends to pursue a Masters  of Business Administration before working in urban economic development in the Caribbean  or South America.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> &quot;I've made some great American friends on and off-campus, as well as friends  from all over the world; they have taught me a lot. For example, last December,  some American friends invited me out into the woods to help cut down their Christmas  tree -- I had never done anything like that before!&quot;</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> When I meet new people, they're always interested to know what it's really like  in Jamaica. That has made me think about my own country, so I could share more information  with them. If I never left home, I would not need to consider these things. So in  many ways, a U.S. education means much more than sitting in a classroom and studying  for a degree.&quot;</p>

                                            You are about to embark on totally NEW experience. &ldquo;New&rdquo; means &quot;recently  discovered, recognized, or learned about; different from the former; being in a  position or place for the first time.&quot; You probably expect that things will  not be the same in the United States as they are in your home country; but are you  prepared to deal with those differences?<br/>
                                            <br/>
                                            New challenges always accompany new experiences. You may occasionally feel confused,  unsure and uncomfortable in the United States. People may have different values  and new ways of doing things that seem strange to you. You may feel that everything  has changed, including your immediate support system of family and friends.<br/>
                                            <br/>
                                            All of these things may contribute to &ldquo;culture shock.&rdquo; To minimize the  shock, you will probably want to keep in touch with family and friends back home&mdash;but  it is important to also identify new sources of support. People that you meet through  your school&rsquo;s international student office may also be a likely source of  support. You could also contact relatives or friends who live in the United States  to ask for their advice.</p></td>

Perhaps you could  continue to practice your own faith on a regular basis, with a group of like-minded  individuals. Or maybe you enjoy jogging, playing chess, or cheering for your favorite  sports team. While the activity will most likely be somewhat &quot;Americanized,&quot;  it may offer comfort to do some of the things that you enjoy in your back in your  home country.<br/>
                                                  <br/>
                                            During the transition from your home country to the U.S., new support will most  likely come from the admissions office or international student office at the U.S.  campus you choose to attend. Most offices coordinate orientation sessions for new  students within the first few days of your arrival, to help you get acquainted with  your new surroundings.<br/>
                                            <br/>
                                            Other forms of support will come from new friends, an academic advisor or psychological  counseling centers. In the U.S., many schools have therapists who have been trained  to work with people just like you to discuss the types of new challenges you face.<br/>
                                            <br/>
                                            Most importantly, be prepared to open yourself to new experiences; be prepared to  learn, not only in the classroom, but in your interactions with new people everyday.</p>
                                              <p align="justify"> American Culture<br/>
                                                As you may know, one of the hallmarks of U.S. culture is independence. Here is some  advice about written by non-U.S. students just like you! In order to make friends,  you must take the initiative to meet people. Because of the American value of independence,  Americans will not always be looking out for you, or making sure that you are getting  acquainted with other people. They assume you are taking care of yourself unless  you tell them differently. If you don't ask for help, Americans will assume you  don't need anything. So remember&mdash;ask for help when you need it!<br/>
                                                Another point of advice: In some cultures, it's polite to refuse two or three times  if someone offers something to you. But in the U.S., it is polite to answer &quot;Yes,  please&quot; if you would like what is being offered. Many interesting situations  have come up when a non-U.S. student who was hungry or thirsty refused the offer  of food or drink, thinking this was polite behavior. But when no second or third  offer was made, there was no chance to say yes.<br/>
                                                Contrary to the stereotype of independence and individuality, most Americans are  conformists and gain their identity by belonging to groups. You may notice that  many students join groups in order to both get acquainted with others and in order  to satisfy a need to belong. You may be surprised at how many students look alike  on your campus, with similar hairstyles and clothing.</p>

                                              <br/>
                                              After your initial interaction with new people in the States, you may want to get  to know a few of them better. Ironically, many international students have found  that they&mdash;not their American hosts&mdash;must be more assertive if a friendship  is to develop. Here is some more advice about the American social life, written  by non-U.S. students just like you:<br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              When you first arrive on campus, you may notice how friendly everyone is. People  you don't know will smile and say &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;How are you&quot; and  &quot;How's it going.&quot; But these statements are not really true questions;  people will most often keep on walking, not waiting for your answer. You may get  the idea they are superficial or perhaps even rude.<br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Americans, however, feel that this kind of greeting and behavior is considered very  friendly; they feel they are being outgoing and welcoming. These greetings are a  social custom which has little to do with friendship. The person may become your  friend eventually, but it is important not to misunderstand the nature of your verbal  exchange.<br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Similarly, people may ask your name and country where you were born; they may seem  interested for a few minutes, but then go and speak to someone else. This may seem  to contradict their initial friendliness, although it is not meant to do so.<br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              You may find it easy to have many &quot;acquaintances&quot; on campus: people seem  to all live together, eat together and study together. However, true friendship  will take time to build. You will realize, maybe for the first time, how much time  it took to develop the friendships you have at home. Then you will appreciate the  time and energy it takes to establish close friendships, both at home and abroad.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Different Ways of Communicating</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              One of the newest forms of communication is also one of the most popular on many  U.S. campuses. Through your interaction with admissions offices in the States, you  may already understand that practically everyone uses e-mail frequently.<br/>
                                              E-mail and the Internet have made it much easier (and sometimes less expensive)  to exchange all types of information. Once you arrive in the States, you will find  that computers and Internet connections are very accessible on most campuses. As  a matter of fact, e-mail plays an important role in the social lives of many Americans  -- as they send and receive messages regularly with friends and family. </p>
                                            <p align="justify"> However, try to resist the urge to spend too many hours in front of the computer;  keep in mind that your visit to the U.S. may not last forever, so go out and socialize  with others to get a full American experience. Make sure you are open to new experiences!<br/>
                                                  <br/>
                                              Socialization is one of the most important aspects of your international experience.  According to the Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, socialization is most strongly  enforced by the school, the family, and peer groups. It is essential for the development  of individuals who can participate and function within their societies, as well  as for ensuring that a society&rsquo;s cultural features will be carried on through  new generations. Socialization continues throughout an individual&rsquo;s lifetime,  and your experience in studying abroad will challenge you to develop your &quot;people  skills&quot; even further.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Accommodation</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              There are a number of options when it comes to deciding where you will live  when you are living and studying in the United States.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>On-campus dormitories</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Once you are enrolled in a U.S. school, the Admissions Department or International  Student Office will most likely send you a &quot;pre-departure orientation&quot;  packet. Options for where to live are generally included in this information.<br/>
                                              Some American schools offer accommodations for international students on-campus,  or near the school's classrooms, libraries and other facilities. &quot;Dormitories&quot;  are buildings with many rooms for sleeping and living, often with two or three people  (of the same gender) per room. Dormitory residents typically share large bathrooms  which include showers and toilets. Many first-year students prefer to live in on-campus  dormitories because they are convenient to both academic and social activities.  Another advantage is that it is not likely that you will not need a car to commute  to campus.<br/>
                                              On-campus accommodations also offer close proximity to the cafeteria and other eating  establishments. U.S. colleges and universities offer very flexible meal-plan programs,  where you can choose to pay in advance for breakfast, lunch and dinner. On most  campuses, you may also deposit a certain amount of money at the beginning of the  semester for food that you may buy from designated places. Each item&rsquo;s cost  is deducted from the balance in your account throughout the semester. Again, your  pre-departure orientation packet will probably detail your eating options.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> Moving into a dormitory setting is relatively simple: utilities such as electricity  and telephone connections will most likely be ready to use. Each U.S. college or  university has its individual policy on paying for long-distance telephone charges;  learn those policies soon after you arrive on campus.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Off-campus options</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Some U.S. schools do not provide on-campus accommodations for international students.  However, an off-campus housing office will assist you in finding an appropriate  place to live. Often, the office coordinates activities to help students find a  compatible roommate to share expenses; they also provide information about the local  neighborhoods, including popular restaurants, shopping areas, parks and recreation,  and public transportation.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> Ask new friends and other students if they have any suggestions for a good apartment.  Check classified advertisements in the local newspaper (Sundays usually have more  apartment listings than other days of the week). If all else fails, contact a real  estate agent for assistance - though beware of unspecified fees for the service.<br/>
                                                  <br/>
                                              Before committing to a lease, or an agreement to rent an apartment, spend some time  in the area to decide if it feels safe and convenient to places like school buildings  and grocery stores. Read the lease carefully before signing. You will learn, for  example, that the landlord is not responsible for your possessions if they are stolen  or destroyed, so you may consider purchasing &quot;renter&rsquo;s insurance.&quot;  If you do not understand any part of the lease agreement, ask the landlord, a friend,  or someone from the international student office to explain it to you.<br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Once you do find off-campus housing, be aware that your rent may well not include  utilities. You will need to request that the companies turn on the electricity and  telephone service when you arrive. The landlord can provide you with the appropriate  contact information.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> You have a choice of long-distance carriers for your telephone service. Be sure  to ask the customer service representatives about special discount calling plans,  particularly for international connections. The representative is usually eager  to offer you a variety of extra services, most of which are not necessary. Soon  after you register for telephone service, you should receive a free telephone directory.  Within the directory, you will find the white pages (listing local residents alphabetically  by name), the blue pages (government listings), and the yellow pages (business listings  and advertisements).<br/>
                                                  <br/>
                                              Many U.S. households have telephone answering machines, which record messages from  callers when no one answers the phone. You may purchase an answering machine for  about $25. Another option is to request that the telephone company provide an electronic  answering service, for which they charge a small monthly fee. Please visit &lt;link  to Int&rsquo;l Student phone card center&gt; for more information on inexpensive  phone cards that will allow you to keep in touch with loved ones back in your home  country.<br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              In most cases, the least expensive way to keep in touch with far-away friends and  family is via e-mail. Again, each U.S. school has its own policies and procedures  for accessing the Internet. If you choose to access your own e-mail off-campus,  you can expect to pay about $20 per month to an Internet Service Provider. </p>
                                            <p align="justify"> Transportation<br/>
                                              Whether you are living on or off campus, in a city or suburb, you have many transportation  options for getting around in your new country:</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Bicycles</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              A bicycle can be a great way to get around your campus and your local area. Whether  your campus is based in the middle of a city or in the suburbs, a bike is relatively  inexpensive, and it&rsquo;s a good way to get some exercise. Whenever riding your  bike, always take care to observe the law of the road, and always wear a helmet.  It is now a law in some states that helmets must be worn. As with any personal property,  take care to lock you bike up when you are not using it. Most college campuses provide  a bike rack for that purpose outside of many buildings on campus. A good lock does  not usually cost very much, and it&rsquo;s a small price to pay for the security  of your bike.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Buses</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              If you are living in a city, the bus system will likely be pretty extensive, as  with most of the public transportation systems in large urban areas. However, if  you live in the suburbs, buses will not run as often and you may have to find alternative  methods to get around. On longer routes, Greyhound runs an extensive bus system  across the USA which is an inexpensive way to travel, but it can take a long time  to get from one place to another. </p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Trains and Subways</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Subways will be found in most major cities in the USA, such as New York, Boston,  and Chicago, and they are a cheap way to travel around. Trains, on the other hand,  are good for traveling the USA. They are slightly more expensive than traveling  by bus, but it is much quicker.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Taxis</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Taxis can be extremely expensive for students, and are good for longer journeys  that are either too far for walking or by bicycle, or there is no bus or subway  system where you want to go. Always remember to check your driver has a valid ID  card which should be displayed (if not ask to see it) and make sure the meter is  running. Never enter a taxi where the driver has asked for a set fee!</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Safety Issues</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Like most issues, safety in the United States is difficult to define because the  United States covers such a large territory.&nbsp; While the U.S. is generally a  very safe place to live, it is still a good idea to educate yourself and take steps  to reduce the potential for problems. By doing so, you will also feel more confident  and comfortable.<br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Developing a sense of &quot;street smarts&quot; takes time, and comes through experience.&nbsp;  You should familiarize yourself with well-lit paths and sidewalks on campus. The  school's security office may offer an escort service, where designated people walk  with you from one place to another on campus, particularly at night.&nbsp; Pay close  attention to your surroundings. Trust your instincts. If a situation appears scary  to you, try to avoid it.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> At &quot;home&quot; (an apartment, private residence or dormitory room), keep your  doors locked, and your large windows closed. Get to know your neighbors, so you  can &quot;watch out&quot; for each other.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> As always, you should use common sense when it comes to safety</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Money Matters</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              As you may have already discovered, paying for a quality education in the United  States can be very expensive. But with proper preparation, you may minimize the  costs of this extraordinary opportunity; visit our Financing page to learn more  about paying for tuition. In this section, we explore money matters that you may  encounter on a daily basis during your adventure in the United States.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> As with any country, it is not advisable to carry large amounts of cash around with  you. There are other options such as credit cards, traveler&rsquo;s checks or bank  cards (also called debit cards), which are all valid forms with which to pay for  things in the United States.<br/>
                                                  <br/>
                                              Traveler&rsquo;s checks are one of the safest and easiest ways to transport money  because you may have them replaced if they get lost or stolen. If you choose to  carry traveler&rsquo;s checks with you from your home country to the States, be  sure they are denominated in U.S. funds. Most businesses&mdash;except taxi drivers  and public transportation personnel&mdash;<br/>
                                              will accept U.S.-denominated traveler&rsquo;s checks during regular business hours,  typically between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. It is wise to bring about  $100 in U.S. cash with you, so you will be able to manage upon your arrival in the  States.</p></td>

                                          <td align="left" class="style1"><p align="justify"> It may take a few days to get used to the new currency. You will learn, for example,  that $1 is a reasonable price for a can of cola out of a vending machine; two dollars  for the same item is expensive. Five dollars for a pizza is inexpensive, while twelve  dollars is expensive.</p>
                                              <p align="justify"> Paper currency, all printed in green and white, is most often circulated in the  amounts of $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 or $100. The slang term for a dollar bill is a  &quot;buck,&rdquo; so $50 may be referred to as &quot;fifty bucks.&quot;</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> Most banks and some major airports and hotels will exchange foreign paper currency  for a service fee; very few, however, exchange foreign coinage. Pay attention to  drastic fluctuations in the exchange rates between your home country&rsquo;s currency  and U.S. currency. If your home currency is decreasing in value, you may wish to  conduct all transactions (like student loans) in U.S. currency.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Bank Accounts</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Within the first few days of your arrival, you may want to open a checking  account with a bank on or near campus. You may directly deposit traveler&rsquo;s  checks for free in most cases, or arrange for a wire transfer from your home bank  for a fee of about $35. Typically, you may make an unlimited number of additional  deposits or withdrawals thereafter. Be sure to always have sufficient funds in your  account to cover all outstanding checks; if you &quot;overdraw,&quot; the bank may  impose expensive fees. Also be aware that there is usually a waiting period of a  few days before you may withdraw the money you deposit, as a way for the bank to  protect itself from fraud.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> You will most likely need some form of identification to open a checking account.  The bank representative may ask you for your Social Security Number. If you do not  have one, fill out an IRS Form W-8, which the bank can supply.<br/>
                                              Most banks offer a number of different types of checking accounts. One might bear  interest if you maintain a minimum balance; another might provide a limited number  of free checks. Learn about all options before deciding which type of account is  best for you.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> Many college students appreciate the convenience of a MAC (Money Access Card) or  ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) card. The card allows account holders to make deposits,  withdrawals and other transactions at any time&mdash;24 hours a day&mdash;through  machines located throughout campus and shopping districts. If you have an ATM card  from a bank in your home country, ask whether the U.S. bank will honor it; some  Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) cross national borders, while others do not.  As a safety precaution, most ATMs limit the daily withdrawal amount to $300. If  you happen to lose your ATM or MAC card, report it immediately to your local bank  office.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> Writing a check is simple. The dollar amount is written twice: once using numerals  ($67.32 for example) and once using words (sixty-seven dollars and 32/100). Draw  one horizontal line through any unused space after the words, to prevent someone  from adding extra digits.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> Once a month, the bank typically mails the account holder a statement of all transactions.  It is important to make sure that their records match your records to ensure that  no errors were made by them or by you. If you have a question about your account,  contact your local bank office.</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> Generally, retail stores accept checks only if they are drawn on an in-state bank.  Be prepared to show some form of photo identification, such as a driver&rsquo;s  license, student I.D., or passport (though you may not want to carry such an important  document with you all the time).</p>
                                            <p align="justify"> <strong>Credit and Debit Cards</strong><br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              One payment option accepted nationwide is the credit card. As a matter of fact,  you may find it difficult to make certain purchases without a credit card. You need  one to place an order by phone, to rent a car, or buy airline tickets in most instances.  A credit card is also a good idea if you want to maintain good financial records,  as your monthly statement will serve as a reminder of how you are spending money.<br/>
                                              A credit card may turn into a very expensive payment option if you are not able  to pay the balance on the account within the specified grace period&mdash;typically  between 20 and 30 days. Be careful to read all of the details of the credit card  offer before committing to it; some companies offer a special low introductory interest  rate (perhaps 2.9%), but then increase it dramatically (to about 18.9%) after that  introductory period. Also know the structure of the credit card company&rsquo;s  annual fees, such as how much and when they charge it to your card. As always, learn  all you can so that you can make an informed decision.<br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              Some companies are reluctant to issue credit cards to international students, as  they do not have an established credit history in the United States. If you already  have a major credit card from your home country (like Eurocard, Access, Chargex,  Barclaycard, Carte Bleue, American Express, Visa or MasterCard), bring it with you;  after the U.S. bank reviews your credit limit on the foreign card, they may be more  likely to offer you a credit card. Banks with which you have accounts are also more  likely to accept your request for a credit card.<br/>
                                              Debit Cards (also referred to as &ldquo;bank cards&rdquo;) are another option. When  you open an account, you will most likely get a bank card which you can use to withdraw  money from an ATM. You can also use it like a credit card to make purchases. Unlike  credit cards, the money is instantly taken from your account, so if the money is  not there it will be rejected.<br/>
                                              <br/>
                                              For students new to the USA, the debit card is a great way to pay for things until  you can establish credit.</p></td>

The UK Border Agency is making a series of important changes to the student visa - Tier 4 of the points-based system.<br><br>
A Tier 4 (General) student who will be studying a course that is below degree level (except a Foundation Degree or an English language course), should be competent in English language at a minimum of level B1 on the CEFR in all four components (reading, writing, speaking and listening). To prove the English Language Competency, students should take an English language test with an approved test provider.</p>
